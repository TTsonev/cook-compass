this is low in fructose, for those who have an issue with fructose and can tolerate cranberries. use honey and agave syrup (or any other sweetener) if you can have it. rice syrup is not as sweet as honey or other syrups, so this cream will be sweeter if you use the same amount of other sweeteners.
the taste of this reminded me of the english gooseberry fool which i enjoyed once in salisbury

 it's so easy to make you won't believe it! cooks notes: if they are available by all means use fresh peaches. in a saucepan, mix two cups fresh peach slices with one cup sugar and one cup water. bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. an almost equally good product is frozen peach slices. simply follow the instructions for the fresh peach slices. note: this is an adopted (late in 2006) recipe and there was already some discussion about the amount of butter necessary in reviews made previous to my inheriting this recipe: now that i have made it myself, i can say that for me at least, 60 grams (1/4 cup) of butter was fine, (by all means use a little less if you prefer) and my dumplings didn't turn out doughy at all... what i did mess up was using a larger can of peaches (non-metric sizes of canned fruit don't translate perfectly into metric ones), so i thought that the extra wouldn't matter much, mine was swimming rather a lot in the juice at the bottom and next time i will use all the peaches but only half or 3/4 of the juice from my metric sized can.. taste was excellent and guests devoured it. i'm delighted to have inherited this recipe, so to both paula deen and the previous zaar owner: thanks for an excellent recipe !!!","['butter', 'sugar', 'self-rising flour', 'milk', 'peach slices in heavy syrup', 'cinnamon']",6
