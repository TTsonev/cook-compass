         "Sure! Here are a few gluten-free meal ideas based on the provided context:\n\n### 1. Gluten-Free Oatmeal Pancakes\n**Name:** Ameaussie's Gluten-Free Oatmeal Pancakes\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- Old-fashioned oats\n- Greek yogurt\n- Skim milk\n- Eggs\n- Flour (gluten-free)\n- Agave nectar\n- Vanilla extract\n- Ground cinnamon\n- Ground ginger\n- Baking powder\n- Salt\n\n**Instructions:**\n1. **Prepare Ahead:** Combine the oats, yogurt, and milk in one bowl, cover, and let soak overnight in the fridge.\n2. **Mix Ingredients:** When ready to cook, whisk the soaked oat mixture with eggs, flour, agave nectar, vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, baking powder, and salt.\n3. **Adjust Consistency:** If the mix is too runny, add more flour (1/4 cup at a time). If it's too dry, add more milk (1/4 cup at a time).\n4. **Cooking:** Heat a griddle or skillet and lightly coat with canola oil. Cook the batter in 4-5 inch circles, flipping when bubbles appear and the edges look dry. Cook the other side for about 1-2 minutes.\n5. **Serve:** Serve plain, buttered, or with your favorite toppings.\n\n### 2. Fresh Egg Pasta (Gluten-Free)\n**Name:** Fresh Egg Pasta (Gluten-Free)\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- Tapioca flour\n- Cornstarch\n- Potato starch\n- Salt\n- Xanthan gum\n- Eggs\n- Vegetable oil\n\n**Instructions:**\n1. **Mix Dry Ingredients:** In a medium bowl, combine the flours, salt, and xanthan gum.\n2. **Combine Wet Ingredients:** Beat the eggs lightly and add the oil. Pour the egg-oil liquid into the flour mixture and stir.\n3. **Form Dough:** This will feel like pastry dough. Work the dough into a firm ball, knead for 1-2 minutes.\n4. **Roll Out:** Place the dough on a potato starch-floured breadboard and roll it as thin as possible. When almost transparent, it will still handle well.\n5. **Cut Pasta:** For fettuccine and spaghetti, slice very thin strips. For a noodle casserole, make slightly wider noodles. For lasagna, cut into 1.5-by-4-inch rectangles.\n"

Gluten-Free Oatmeal Pancakes\n**Name:** Ameaussie's Gluten-Free Oatmeal Pancakes\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- Old-fashioned oats\n- Greek yogurt\n- Skim milk\n- Eggs\n- Flour (gluten-free)\n- Agave nectar\n- Vanilla extract\n- Ground cinnamon\n- Ground ginger\n- Baking powder\n- Salt\n\n**Instructions:**\n1. **Prepare Ahead:** Combine the oats, yogurt, and milk in one bowl, cover, and let soak overnight in the fridge.\n2. **Mix Ingredients:** When ready to cook, whisk the soaked oat mixture with eggs, flour, agave nectar, vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, baking powder, and salt.\n3. **Adjust Consistency:** If the mix is too runny, add more flour (1/4 cup at a time). If it's too dry, add more milk (1/4 cup at a time).\n4. **Cooking:** Heat a griddle or skillet and lightly coat with canola oil. Cook the batter in 4-5 inch circles, flipping when bubbles appear and the edges look dry. Cook the other side for about 1-2 minutes.\n5. **Serve:** Serve plain, buttered, or with your favorite toppings.\n\n### 2.

Pour the egg-oil liquid into the flour mixture and stir.\n3. **Form Dough:** This will feel like pastry dough. Work the dough into a firm ball, knead for 1-2 minutes.\n4. **Roll Out:** Place the dough on a potato starch-floured breadboard and roll it as thin as possible. When almost transparent, it will still handle well.\n5. **Cut Pasta:** For fettuccine and spaghetti, slice very thin strips. For a noodle casserole, make slightly wider noodles. For lasagna, cut into 1.5-by-4-inch rectangles.\n"

Here are a few gluten-free recipes from the provided context:\n\n### 1. **Gluten-Free Salmon Recipe**\n**Name:** Gluten-Free Salmon Recipe  \n**Ingredients:**  \n- Wild salmon  \n- Lemon juice  \n- Salted anchovies  \n- Rosemary  \n- Kalamata olives  \n- Garlic cloves  \n- Olive oil  \n\n**Instructions:**  \n1. Rinse salmon fillets.  \n2. Place in a 10 x 7 inch baking dish.  \n3. Drizzle with lemon juice.  \n4. In a food processor, place anchovies, rosemary, olives, garlic, and olive oil. Pulse until mixture turns into a coarse paste.  \n5. Spread the paste over the salmon fillets.  \n6. Bake in a preheated oven at 375°F for about 20-25 minutes or until the salmon is cooked through.\n\n### 2. **Ameraussie's Gluten-Free Oatmeal Pancakes**\n**Name:** Ameraussie's Gluten-Free Oatmeal Pancakes  \n**Ingredients:**  \n- Old-fashioned oats  \n- Greek yogurt  \n- Skim milk  \n- Eggs  \n- Flour (gluten-free)  \n- Agave nectar  \n- Vanilla extract  \n- Ground cinnamon  \n- Ground ginger  \n- Baking powder  \n- Salt  \n\n**Instructions:**  \n1. Prepare ahead by combining oats, yogurt, and milk in one bowl. Cover and let soak overnight in the fridge.  \n2. When ready to cook, whisk the soaked oat mixture with eggs, flour, agave nectar, vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, baking powder, and salt.  \n3. Mix well. If the mixture is too runny, add more flour, 1/4 cup at a time. If it's too dry, add more milk, about 1/4 cup.  \n4. Heat a griddle or skillet and lightly coat with canola oil. Use low to medium heat.  \n5. Spoon about 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle to form a 4-5 inch circle. Cook until bubbles appear and the outer edges start to look dry.  \n6. Flip the pancake and cook the other side for about 1-2 minutes.  \n7. Serve plain, buttered, or with your favorite toppings.  \n8. Cooking time is per pancake, and cooking one at a time takes more time than cooking multiple at once.\n\n### 3. **Quick Gluten-Free S"
